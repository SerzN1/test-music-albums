# Ultimate Guitar test

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

I tried to do some possible stuff in a short time and I spent about 4 hours.

Now it works and some pieces of my code should be improved. For example unit tests coverage `yarn test`.
 
I would like to see and work with guys who can do such high quality programs in an hour, because other guys say that I write code quite quickly.

All that possible in an hour is to setup environment, study api docs and write some 'dirty' code for API requests.

If you thought about this prototype and gave them to other challengers about 10 times you would be prepared to repeat code but not to write first time in and hour.

Thanks for nice challenge.
